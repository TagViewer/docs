# Welcome to TagViewer's documentation!

## Getting Started

If this is your first time using TagViewer, you can either start with the [Beginner's Guide](beginners-guide/) or with the [Step-by-Step Tutorial](step-by-step-tutorial/), depending on how you like to learn. If you want to see results at every step, use the Step-by-Step Tutorial. If you like a fairly in-depth look at each feature \(but still suitable for beginners\), use the Beginner's Guide.

We suggest that you read [About TagViewer](about-tagviewer.md) first, to understand what it is and whether it's right for you.

And of course, you'll have to [install TagViewer](installation.md) before you can start.

## Configuration Guide

This is how you make TagViewer work exactly as you want. **This is for more advanced users.** Start [here](configuration-guide/).
