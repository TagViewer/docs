# Miscellaneous

### Slideshows

TagViewer supports slideshows. You can configure the time each item is shown \([in the Settings dialog](../configuration-guide/settings.md#duration-to-show-each-item-in-seconds-number) or by [editing the JSON](../configuration-guide/json-configuration.md#slideshowinterval)\). To start one you can use the accelerator `Cmd/Ctrl + S`, the button in the top bar, or the menu bar entry, and you can end one similarly, the accelerator being `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S`.

### Fullscreen

To enter fullscreen mode, press `F11`, use the button in the top bar, or click the menu bar entry. To exit, press `Esc` or `F11`, use the same button in the top bar you used to enter it, or click the menu bar entry if you operating system allows you to access it.

While in fullscreen mode, all of the menus, asides, and what-not are minimized. To open one, you can put your cursor up to the edge of the screen that that section is on. When your cursor exits that section, it will be minimized again.

### Color Schemes

The only color schemes currently offered are light and dark. To decide it,  However, you can manually configure the theme colors in the JSON \(see [here](../configuration-guide/json-configuration.md#themeoverrides-and-themeinjections) for more info\).
