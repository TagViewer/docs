# Media

The media is the purpose of your TagSpace. When you add media to a TagSpace, it is all shown on the left in the File List. When you add filters, only the media that matches those filters is shown. For example, to emulate a rudimentary title search function, you would add a "Title includes &lt;keyword&gt;" filter.

As stated in the previous page, you can change the applied tags and the values of the properties for the current media in the Properties tab. The properties are shown first: If you type a value, it will be set for that media. If you leave the box blank, the property will be unset and it will be stored as "Noval" in the database. \(For boolean properties, if you double-click the checkbox it will become undefined and the checkbox will have a dash through it.\) We'll cover in the Filters and Sorting section what that means for you. Below that the applied and available \(not currently applied\) tags are shown. Applied tags are removed with the minus symbol and available tags are added with the plus symbol.
