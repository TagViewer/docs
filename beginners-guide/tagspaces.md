# TagSpaces

In the filesystem, a TagSpace is just a directory with images and a special file telling TagViewer everything it needs to know about those images, but don't let that fool you! TagSpaces are a powerful way to store data relating to your media, and TagViewer uses them to keep its data relating to that media.

In addition to storing your media, a TagSpace stores the list of tags and properties that can be applied to the media. You can edit these in the TagSpace Configuration dialog.
