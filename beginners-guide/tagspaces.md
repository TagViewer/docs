# TagSpaces

In the filesystem, a TagSpace is just a directory with images and a special file telling TagViewer everything it needs to know about those images, but don't let that fool you! TagSpaces are a powerful way to store data relating to your media, and TagViewer uses them to keep its data relating to that media.

In addition to storing your media, a TagSpace stores the list of tags and properties that can be applied to the media. You can edit these in the TagSpace Configuration dialog.

The tags and properties that you've added can be applied to any media in the TagSpace in the Properties tab when that media is open. In addition, you can filter by tags or properties in the Filters tab, and sort by properties under the files in the File List.
