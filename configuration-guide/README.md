# Configuration Guide

When you start noticing little things that don't work how you'd like, or features you'd like to tweak, this is the section for you. You can look at [Problem & Solution](problem-and-solution.md) as an index for the rest of the content.

{% hint style="info" %}
At the moment, there is not a ton of configuration, but we're looking to add more so please don't hesitate to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/TagViewer/tagviewer), or [send me an email](mailto:mattf53190@gmail.com?subject=TagViewer%20Feature%20Request%3A).
{% endhint %}
