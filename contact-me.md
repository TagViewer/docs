# Contact Me

You can contact me at [mattf53190@gmail.com](mailto:mattf53190@gmail.com?subject=TagViewer:+). For TagViewer-related mail, I ask that you start the subject line with `TagViewer:`  , which will be done for you if you click any of the mailto links on this site.

I value privacy. To communicate sensitive information, I implore you to encrypt the message with my PGP key that can be fetched from `hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net` with the following shell command \(using GPG as it's fairly common\):

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --search-keys mattf53190@gmail.com
```

Select the key named "Matt Fellenz \(General Use Key\)". This will have downloaded the key, at which point you can encrypt your message that you've previously saved to a file:

```bash
gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r mattf53190@gmail.com <file>
```

Of course, if I want to reply I will need your public key. Please have it sent to `hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net` and include your key's fingerprint in the message.
