# Installation

Begin by opening the latest release on GitHub. There, you'll see the binaries and packages. If you know what you're doing, just download the one you need. If not, continue reading.

## Windows

You can use the .exe installer or the MSI. Download and run the setup .exe / MSI file.

## Linux

### Debian-based Distros

You have two options. Either download the .deb and install it; or add `ppa:tagviewer/tagviewer` and install TagViewer using APT.

### RPM-based Distros

The process is essentially the same. Either download the .rpm and install it, or add _the repository RPM_ and then install TagViewer using your package manager.

### `pacman` Distros

Download _the package_ from the AUR and install it with `makepkg -si`.

### "Build from source"

Of course you can just download the .zip \(not the source code listed at the bottom of the releases\) and run it with `electron .`.

### Snap, Flatpak, etc.

Snaps, Flatpaks, and any other similar formats are not supported. We suggest that you follow one of the above options instead.
