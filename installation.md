# Installation

Begin by opening the latest release on GitHub. There, you'll see the binaries and packages. If you know what you're doing, just download the one you need. If not, continue reading.

## Windows

Squirrel.Windows does not work on Linux or Windows \(at least for me\). Therefore, for now there are no binaries available for Windows. If you are able to package the application on Windows, please [contact me](mailto:mattf53190@gmail.com?subject=TagViewer:+I+can+package+for+Windows) so I can add it to the releases.

## MacOS

Since you need a Mac to make a package for MacOS, at the moment there are no packages for MacOS. If you are able to package the application for MacOS, please [contact me](mailto:mattf53190@gmail.com?subject=TagViewer:+I+can+package+for+MacOS) so I can add it to the releases.

## Linux

### Debian-based Distros

Download the .deb and install it.

### RPM-based Distros

Download the .rpm and install it.

### `pacman` Distros

Though I'd love to offer a pacman package, I can't seem to find how to put an alternation in the depends field of the PKGBUILD, which is necessary for TagViewer. If you can help with this, please contact me. For now, use the .zip package.

### "Build from source"

Of course you can just download the .zip \(not the source code listed at the bottom of the releases\) and run it with `electron .`.

### Snap, Flatpak, etc.

Snaps, Flatpaks, and any other similar formats are not supported. We suggest that you follow one of the above options instead.
