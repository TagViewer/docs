# Installation

Begin by opening the latest release on GitHub. There, you'll see the binaries and packages. If you know what you're doing, just download the one you need. If not, continue reading.

## Windows

Squirrel.Windows does not work on Linux or Windows \(at least for me\). Therefore, for now there are no binaries available for Windows. If you are able to package the application on Windows, please [contact me](mailto:mattf53190@gmail.com?subject=TagViewer:+I+can+package+for+Windows) so I can add it to the releases.

## MacOS

Download the DMG file, then open it and drag it into your Applications folder.

## Linux

### Debian-based Distros

Download the .deb and install it.

### RPM-based Distros

The process is essentially the same. Download the .rpm and install it,.

### `pacman` Distros

Download _the package_ from the AUR and install it with `makepkg -si`.

### "Build from source"

Of course you can just download the .zip \(not the source code listed at the bottom of the releases\) and run it with `electron .`.

### Snap, Flatpak, etc.

Snaps, Flatpaks, and any other similar formats are not supported. We suggest that you follow one of the above options instead.
