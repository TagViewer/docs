Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated. Ways you can help:

* **Multilinguals:** Translations are currently not implemented, but when I do I'd love to have some already done. Just send me a copy of [the translation phrases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tagviewer/tagviewer/main/translatorphrases.txt) with translations of each line, and any localization notes in the allotted space. My email is [mattf53190@gmail.com](mailto:mattf53190@gmail.com?subject=TagViewer%3A%20Translation%20in%20%3Clanguage%3E) \(if you use the template, replace `<language>` with the language you've translated the phrases into\).
* **Developers:** You can help fix bugs and implement features and enhancements from GitHub. Please read the notes in [the GitHub repo's ReadMe](https://github.com/tagviewer/tagviewer/blob/main/README.md).
* **Anyone:** You can find issues in TagViewer and [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/tagviewer/tagviewer/issues/new), or just [email me feedback](mailto:mattf53190@gmail.com?subject=TagViewer:%20My%20Feedback) on the application.
